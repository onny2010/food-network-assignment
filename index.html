        <p>Pizza is the ultimate comfort food loved by both kids and adults. It’s one of those dishes that just thinking
            of it puts a smile on your face. The bad thing is, it can be quite unhealthy as is high in calories and when
            consumed constantly can contribute to bad eating habits and not the greatest health condition.

            Luckily, there is a solution. Instead of ordering it, put in the effort and make a homemade pizza from
            scratch. Here are some tips on how to make it healthier yet still equally enjoyable and delicious. </p>

                <h3>Broccoli Potato Soup</h3>
                <p>Place onion and hash browns in 3-quart saucepan. Cover with chicken broth. Cover pan and simmer until
                    tender, about 10 minutes.
                    Add broccoli and simmer another 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in milk, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and
                    nutmeg.
                    Heat until hot, Top with shredded Swiss cheese.</p>

                <h3>Finnish Salmon Soup (Lohikeitto)</h3>
                <p>In times past, Finnish food was seasonal; in winter there were no easily available green vegetables,
                    etc., as there are now – and the primary purpose for food was to provide energy in the harsh
                    climate. As a result many traditional Finnish recipes are simple dishes consisting of meat (or fish)
                    and easily stored staples such as potatoes. Lohikeitto is one of these traditional dishes – and as a
                    bonus, it’s easy to prepare. As with many Finnish recipes, Dill is used for flavouring (Finns seem
                    to like their Dill).</p>

                <h3>Alboronia</h3>
                <p>The eggplant and zucchini are cut into cubes. The green pepper, tomatoes and onions are finely
                    chopped.

                    The oil is heated in a deep frying pan and the chopped onion is added. As soon as it is golden, add
                    the eggplant, squash, peppers, and, lastly, the tomatoes. Cover and let cook for a while, then put
                    in the allspice, the flour and a little pepper. A cup of water can be added, and salt is added to
                    taste. Let it all cook slowly until the dish sits in its own sauce. Serves six.</p>
